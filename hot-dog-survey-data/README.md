# Hot Dog Survey Data

Tasks: 

- In this README file, briefly describe the project. 
- Create a separate markdown file as a data dictionary. Look at examples from last terms.

The goal of the project is to test the hypothesis: One third of UVA undergraduate students believe that a hotdog is not a sandwhich. In order to collect data and perform analysis, a survey was sent out. Questions on the survey included asking whether or not a hot dog was a sandwhich, asking about the rational, and collecting some demographic data like major and geographical area born.
